Hi my name is Cindy, 

I am an MSc Business Analytics candidate at the Ivey School of Business, who wants to leverage my leadership and analytical skills to make a positive impact through my work and inspire those around me to do the same. As businesses become increasingly technologically dependent and consumers become increasingly socially aware, I want to play a role in helping organizations do good by doing good.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy hiking, travelling, dancing and reading biographies/personal finance books. 

My favourite quote is: “Fight for things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.” - Ruth Bader Ginsburg
My favourite book is: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
