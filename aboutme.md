## Short and Sweet

Hi my name is Cindy, 

I am an MSc Business Analytics candidate at the Ivey School of Business, who wants to leverage my leadership and analytical skills to make a positive impact through my work and inspire those around me to do the same. As businesses become increasingly technologically dependent and consumers become increasingly socially aware, I want to play a role in helping organizations do good by doing good.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy hiking, travelling, dancing and reading biographies/personal finance books. 

My favourite quote is: “Fight for things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.” - Ruth Bader Ginsburg

My favourite book is: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell

My favourite food is: Homemade Vietnamese food

## How I got to where I am today?

As someone who is passionate about making a positive impact through my work and helping others, I initially pursued a career in science. I graduated with my BSc in Medical sciences in 2018 and received multiple dental school admissions, which was the goal at the time. Although this was a goal that I had been working towards for many years when I received my acceptance and envisioned my future, I quickly came to realize that I did not want to pursue a career that would just give me a comfortable lifestyle, I wanted something challenging and fast-paced. I wanted to pursue a career that would allow me to learn and grow every day because that is what drives me. 

So I turned down the offers and began to push myself outside of my comfort zone to find what it was that I am that passionate about. I became an operations associate at Chubb and took various online courses in accounting, finance, and programming while working. This was a pivotal experience for me because it showed me how my experiences as a science student were transferrable to a business environment and how I could make an impact while pursuing a career in business. During my time at Chubb, I joined the CARE committee, led a local volunteer initiative, and helped organize our United Way Campaign. These experiences allowed me to make an impact on my community but also helped me form many meaningful relationships within the organization. 

Although I enjoyed my experience at Chubb, I knew that I wanted to become a more well-rounded employee and make a bigger impact at the organization that I was working at. So I decided to go back to school for my MSc in Business Analytics so that I could further develop my business acumen and soft skills while also building my technical skillset. To date, my favourite courses have been Finance and Simulation and Risk Analysis. I am excited to leverage the knowledge that I have gained to build a career that is intellectually stimulating and socially rewarding.
