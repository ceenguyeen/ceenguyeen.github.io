## What is the best way to construct a Portfolio and minimize downside risks?

Every investors goal is to maximize upside reward and minimize downside risks, but what is the best way to do this? There are multiple theoretical techniques that can be used to construct a portfolio and minimize downside risks. 

# 1. Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio

# 2. Global Minimum Variance Portfolio

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
